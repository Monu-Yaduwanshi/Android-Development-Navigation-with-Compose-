# Android-Development-Navigation-with-Compose-
# Android Navigation App

This is a simple Android application built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** for navigation between multiple pages. The app demonstrates basic navigation between screens (First Page, Second Page, and Third Page) using the `NavHost` and `NavController` components. Firebase Database is also integrated for backend data handling.

## Features
- Navigation between multiple pages using `NavHost` and `NavController`
- Material Design components like `Button`, `Text`, `Icon`, and more
- Jetpack Compose-based UI, which provides a modern toolkit for building native Android UIs
- Firebase Database integration for handling backend data storage and retrieval

## Project Structure
- **FirstPage**: Initial screen that provides navigation to the second page.
- **SecondPage**: A middle page that allows navigation to both the first and third pages.
- **ThirdPage**: Final page in the flow of navigation.
- **MainNavigationApp**: Contains the navigation host and defines the composable routes.

## Technologies Used
- **Android Studio**: IDE for Android development.
- **Kotlin**: Programming language used to write the code.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
- **Firebase Database**: Backend for storing and retrieving app data.
